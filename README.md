# ATM_Management_System
The ATM Management System is a console-based Java application that simulates real-world ATM functionalities using a MySQL database. It allows users to securely log in using their account number and PIN, and then perform typical banking operations like checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing cash, transferring funds to another account, and viewing a mini statement.

To develop a secure and user-friendly banking system that:

  -Provides essential banking services from an ATM interface

  -Ensures data security using PIN verification

  -Handles transactions with consistency using SQL and JDBC


ðŸ§¾ Functional Requirements:
    
    Login: Users must provide a valid account number and PIN.

    Check Balance: Shows current account balance.

    Deposit: Allows users to add money to their account.

    Withdraw: Allows users to withdraw money after balance check.

    Transfer: Enables fund transfer between two accounts with rollback support.

    Mini Statement: Displays user's account number, name, and balance.
