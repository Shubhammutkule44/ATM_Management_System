# ATM_Management_System
The ATM Management System is a console-based Java application that simulates real-world ATM functionalities using a MySQL database. It allows users to securely log in using their account number and PIN, and then perform typical banking operations like checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing cash, transferring funds to another account, and viewing a mini statement.
